# Tnp MIDI Synth

Learning DSP and MIDI handling by gradually stacking functionality on this main synthesiser project. 

## Building

Both /Builds and /JuceLibraryCode folders are ignored but it is my understanding that if you have the Projucer tool installed and run the .jucer file those will be automatically generated. The volume envelope class files used were taken from [this website](http://www.earlevel.com/main/2013/06/03/envelope-generators-adsr-code/) and created by Nigel Redmon.
## Built With

* [JUCE](https://juce.com/) - Framework used
* [ADSR](http://www.earlevel.com/main/2013/06/03/envelope-generators-adsr-code/) - Volume envelope used
