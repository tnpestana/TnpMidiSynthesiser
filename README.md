# Pesto's First Synthesiser

I am learning DSP and MIDI handling by gradually stacking functionality on this main synthesiser project. 

## Building

Both /Builds and /JuceLibraryCode folders are ignored but it is my understanding that if you have the Projucer tool installed and run the .jucer file those will be automatically generated. Head over to [this website](http://www.earlevel.com/main/2013/06/03/envelope-generators-adsr-code/) to download the volume envelope class files, store them locally and add their path to Projucer's  "Header search path".

## Built With

* [JUCE](https://juce.com/) - Framework used
* [ADSR](http://www.earlevel.com/main/2013/06/03/envelope-generators-adsr-code/) - Volume envelope used

## Author

* **Tiago Neves Pestana** - [tnpestana](https://github.com/tnpestana)
